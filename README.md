# RATING-RELIABILITY-OF-ONLINE-PRODUCT-REVIEWS
My project was basically to rate the reliability of Product reviews from an online store.
I was working under the concept of mind and machines.
So, working on intuitions was not a wise idea.
I created few parameters and then released a google form among masses to confirm my perceptions.

I later constructed a program that would analyse our data and work/produce outputs as similar as possible to the humans.

Let me know if there are any problems in accessing files.
P.S. Might need to edit excel's file location in the python code.
